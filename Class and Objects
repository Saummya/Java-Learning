Java is an Object-Oriented Language.

It means that Java programs are created using the main building blocks like class and 
object. Java programs apply Object-Oriented principles such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

An instance of a class contains its own copy of variables (attributes) and the methods (behavior) with all the other objects of that class.
Objects collaborate by exchanging messages with one another via method invocations (i.e., invoking each other's behaviors).

Hence through an object-oriented approach, we derive class, state, and behavior.

If a Banking application has to be developed using an object-oriented approach, we need to first identify a set of classes and model their state and behavior.

For Example: If we consider Bank as a class, the major operations it needs to perform are: creating an account, deleting an account, setting the bank location, and contact details.

So we model Bank as a class.

The state of Bank classâ€™s object is specified by its attributes area, phoneNo and account. The methods createAccount(), deleteAccount(), setArea(), setPhoneNo() specifies the behavior of this object.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________
The class Account defines the state and the behavior of an object. The state is defined by the member variable/attribute balance and the behavior is defined by the member function/method getBalance().
Look at this example of the Account class.

public class Account {
  private double balance = 500.00;
  public double  getBalance(int accountId) {
    // logic here
    return balance;
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Account accnt = new Account();
    double value = accnt.getBalance(123456);
    System.out.println("The balance is: " + value);
  }
}

Write, compile, and execute this sample code. I will guide you.

public class Account {
  private double balance = 500.00;    // State/variable
  public double getBalance(int accountId) { // Behaviour/method
    // logic here
    return balance;
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {    // main method
    Account accnt = new Account();            // Object creation
    double value = accnt.getBalance(123456);  // Method invocation
    System.out.println("The balance is: " + value);
  }
}
